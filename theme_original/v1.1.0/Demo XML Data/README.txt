!!!!PLEASE NOTE -- DO NOT INSTALL THIS DEMO DATA UNTIL YOU HAVE INSTALLED THE THEME & THE REQUIRED PLUGINS WHICH THE THEME MENTIONS!!!!!

Hey there,

This is a polite notice, please note that installing the demo data will not instantly give you a site as my demo, instead, you'll need to read through and follow the steps in my documentation afterwards, with the demo data installed this should take you around 30mins to one hour, the benefit though, is that you'll have a great understanding of the workings of the theme.

Full documentation is provided in the download as long as you grab the 'main files and documentation' zip from themeforest. Unzip it, inside is documentation and demo data files.

You'll find the best way to work, is to install the theme, then the required plugins, then the demo data. With that installed you'll still have a few steps to make, follow the documentation from top to bottom, you'll find the demo data did a lot of the work for you. In doing this you'll also get a much better understanding of the theme.

Take your time with it :)

Cheers!

Guide to Files:

demo-data.xml -> The Main Demo-Data file for the theme
woocommerce.xml -> Simple product demos if you need them, these are also included in demo-data.xml
home-1.txt.html -> The Revolution Slider from my theme demo, this is imported in the Revolution Slider Plugin
